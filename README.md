## About Me
I am a data enthusiast with experience in machine learning, data analysis, and model development. My projects span various domains, from retail and telecommunications to natural language processing and computer vision. I enjoy tackling real-world problems by building predictive models and providing data-driven insights.

## Project Summaries

### 1. Customer Age Prediction for "Khleb-Sol" Supermarket
**Description:** 
Developed a computer vision model to estimate customer age from photographs taken at checkout zones. This helps in targeted product recommendations and compliance with alcohol sales regulations.
**Highlights:**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis.
- Trained a neural network using a dataset of labeled images.
- Achieved model performance measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction for "TeleDom" Telecommunications
**Description:** 
Built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn for a telecommunications company. This model supports retention strategies by targeting high-risk customers with special offers.
**Highlights:**
- Combined customer data from multiple sources.
- Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- Trained multiple machine learning models and optimized hyperparameters.

### 3. Toxic Comment Classification for "Wikishop"
**Description:** 
Implemented a natural language processing (NLP) model to detect toxic comments in a user-editable product description platform. The tool automates the moderation process, ensuring a healthy community environment.
**Highlights:**
- Preprocessed and transformed text data using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Trained a logistic regression model.
- Achieved an F1 score of at least 0.75, meeting the project requirements.

## Conclusion
Each project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to solve diverse business problems. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and improve user experiences.
